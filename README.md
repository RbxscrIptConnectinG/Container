# Container
such a way - such a shame.

heyaaa..
as you can see.
Container moved from [UselessStuff](https://github.com/RbxscrIptConnectinG/UselessStuff) to its own repository

there's many reasons why, for example:
1. hi.
2. maybe publishing it to.. *GULP* [wally](https://wally.run/)..

API is coming soon.. but for now
just check source code to check what functions do
